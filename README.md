# PAF-KIET-Network-Simulation-Topology

This repository contains the network topology I designed as part of the Data Communication and Networking (DCN) course. The topology represents the complete multi-campus network structure of PAF-KIET, covering the Main Campus, City Campus, and North Campus.

The design illustrates inter-campus connectivity, hierarchical subnet arrangements, intermediate devices, routing paths, switch layers, and end-user nodes. It highlights how the three campuses communicate through core routers, distribution switches, and access-layer devices.
